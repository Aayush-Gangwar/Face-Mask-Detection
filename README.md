# DL model optimization for Lightweight Face Mask Detection

Automatic detention of whether a person is wearing a mask or not
from either camera input or microphone input of mobile phones or
microcontrollers.

## Training the face mask detector model
We have fine-tuned [MobileNet V2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381) model / architecture with pre-trained [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/) weights.

## Using the trained model
After training the face mask detector model, it is then loaded to perform face mask detection.
